# Task: Routing

## Objective

Your task is to write a router that takes into account multiple metrics and returns the best route for a given request.

## Specifications

* The script should be written in a language you're comfortable with. There are two starter examples in Go and Python, but you can use any language you want.

## Pre-requisites

The setup is created using Docker and Docker Compose. You will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

To run the setup use `docker-compose up --build`. You can the use `curl http://0.0.0.0:8880` or `curl http://0.0.0.0:8881` to test the setup.

## Deliverables

Your completed task should include the following:

* The script file.
* A README.md file that includes the following:
  * Instructions on how to run the script.
  * Any necessary setup instructions, such as environment variables or dependencies that need to be installed.
  * An explanation of how the script works.


## Evaluation

Your task will be evaluated on the following criteria:

* Correctness: Does the script perform a regular backup as specified?
* Error Handling: Does the script appropriately handle and log errors?
* Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, easy to read, and appropriately commented?
* Documentation: Is the README.md file clear and does it explain how to set up and run the script, and does it explain how the script works?
* Edge Cases: Are there any edge cases, or optimisations we should keep in mind when the volume of data increases?
* Please remember that this is not just about getting the script to work. We're interested in your problem-solving process and your approach to writing code and documentation.

Good luck!
